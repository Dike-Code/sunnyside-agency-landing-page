A Sunny Agency Landing Page Solution from the Challange presented by Frontend Mentor... it's built with a pure HTML5 for laying out the structure, CSS for styling the website to make it more compelling, responsive and user friendly... A little bit of Javascript was also utilized in order to make the site more interactive.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-  View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-  See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

```html
  <!-- The Mobile navbar -->
```

```css
  .navigation.active {
      position: absolute;
      top: 100%;
      left: 0;
      width: 100%;
      height: 50vh;
      opacity: 1;
      z-index: 1;
      background: transparent;
      transition: 0.5s;
   }

   .navbar {
      position: relative;
      background: #fff;
      flex-direction: column;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
      width: 100%;
      height: auto;
      border-radius: 5px;
      padding: 20px;
   }
   .navbar::after {
      content: "";
      position: absolute;
      top: 0;
      right: 0;
      width: 100px;
      height: 50px;
      background: var(--White);
      transform: rotate(-51deg) translate(4%, 0%);
      z-index: -1;
      border-radius: 10px;
   }
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
   console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

All, Practice... Practice and Practice.

### Useful resources

-  [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com) - Traversy Media is a Youtube Channel pioneered by Brad Traversy it helped me with the full asimillation of CSS FLEX BOX and Grid. I really liked the pattern Brad uses in explaining all the concepts one needs to master a given craft.

-  [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com) - This is an amazing website/platform which helped me finally understand a lot including the snippets on buiding a dropdown list. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
